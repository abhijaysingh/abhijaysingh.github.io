Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a graduate student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu). Currently, I am interning at [Synopsys Inc.](https://www.synopsys.com/ai/ai-powered-eda.html) where I am working on understanding long documents using language models.  

Prior to my Masters, I was a Software Engineer in the Product and Innovation team at [HoloSuit Pte. Ltd.](https://www.holoworld.one). 

I completed my undergrad from [JSS Science and Technology University](https://www.sjce.ac.in) (formerly SJCE), Mysore, India in 2020.
