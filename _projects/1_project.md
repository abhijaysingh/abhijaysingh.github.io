The goal of this project was to develop a system for teleoperating a humanoid robot using a full-body motion capture suit. The robot was built by [HoloSuit Pte. Ltd.](https://www.holoworld.one/) (Team RobotGuru) to compete in the [ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/avatar/articles/38-semifinalist-teams-from-16-countries-aim-to-create-an-avatar-system), which challenges teams to create an avatar system that can enable a human operator to see, hear, and interact with a remote environment in a realistic way.

My contributions to this project focused on translating the operator's movements, captured by the motion suit (HoloSuit) in real-time, into control signals for the robot. This allowed the operator to walk, gesture, and manipulate objects from a first-person perspective through the robotic avatar. 

Another aspect was creating 3D visualizations to provide the operator with immersive visual feedback from the robot's perspective in real-time. Using data from the robot's sensors, I generated a virtual representation of the remote environment that aligned spatially with the operator's point of view. This visualization allowed the operator to seamlessly control the robot and interact with the environment using their own body movements.

The teleoperated humanoid robot system we developed enabled a human operator to intuitively control a robotic avatar across long distances and complete dexterous tasks through the robot. This project combined motion capture, real-time robotics control, and 3D visualization to create an immersive and natural bi-directional telepresence experience.

I am open to discussing this project in more detail. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
