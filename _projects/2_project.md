The goal of this project was to develop a performance enhancement exoskeleton system that allows the user to carry heavy payloads with minimal effort. The custom exoskeleton suit transfers the weight of loads directly to the ground through powered joints, enabling extended carrying capacity and endurance.

 Due to the proprietary and confidential nature of this project, further technical details on the exoskeleton system cannot be provided here.
