Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Currently, I am interning at Synopsys where I am working on document interpretation using large language models. 

Prior to my Masters, I was a Software Engineer in the Product and Innovation team at HoloSuit Pte. Ltd. 

I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from JSS Science and Technology University (formerly SJCE), Mysore, India in 2020.
