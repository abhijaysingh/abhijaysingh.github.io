I worked on developing a software development kit (SDK) for a motion capture suit that could stream data to various 3D animation and game development applications. The SDK allowed real-time motion capture data from the suit to be processed and normalized before being transmitted via plugins to third party software like Unity, Unreal Engine, Maya, and Blender.

My contributions included:
1. Developing the SDK and APIs to ingest raw sensor data from the motion capture suit, process and normalize the data into a consistent format for streaming.
2. Creating plugins and integrations for major 3D animation/game engines and content creation tools including Unity, Unreal Engine, Autodesk Maya, and Blender. The plugins enabled two-way communication so that the motion data could drive animations in real-time and also allow for in-software control of the motion capture session.
3. Optimizing data pipelines from the SDK to the client applications to enable high-framerate, low-latency streaming of full body motion capture data across multiple applications simultaneously.
4. Contributing to the design and development of the SDK and client plugins to provide an easy to use motion capture system that was flexible across many different use cases from animation to VR/AR.

The end result was an extensible SDK that allowed high quality, responsive motion capture data to be leveraged in a variety of professional 3D animation and game creation tools.
